# Cryptocurrency Machine Learning
---
## Overview
This project looks to use unsupervised machine learning to cluster and analyze cryptocurrency data to make informed insights into the crytocurrency market. The script cleans and prepares the data to be analyzed then utilizes the PCA and t-SNE models to reduce the dimensionality to optimize functionality. From there, the k-means model is then used to cluster the data for it to be classifed.

## Effectiveness
As this project attempts to group cryptocurrencies as a means of classifying them, it should be noted that it is possible to cluster cryptocurrencies though not simply. This process takes a great deal of pre-processing and adjusting as cryptocurrencies have a great deal of variance within their outputs thus leading to a wide array of data that must be sorted through and redimentionalized.
